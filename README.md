## slightly object oriented rebuild of Redux while adhering to the 3 principles :
####  Single source of truth
###### The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.  
&nbsp;
#### State is read-only
###### The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
&nbsp;
#### Changes are made with pure functions
###### To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.
